## Feedback for Day 1

- **What went well, what did you learn that you are excited about using in your work?**

   - The pipe | will be extremely useful

   - Instead of going to the web to find what each - does every time you can use ls --help instead as well as using |

   - Very helpful and basic knowledge.

   - All very well paced and easy to follow

   - Really a good start for working in Shell evoriment

   - Several important Unix commands were introduced during the workshop 

- **What could be improved, what was not clear, what needs more explanations?**

   - Want to learn how to move files from remote unix system to windows.

   - Maybe how to set up a directory system appropriate for work and data management

   - Difference between a root user and non root user ?

   - Maybe you could teach using tab to see all the files in the directory and autocomplete when writng a command. Maybe its in part 2
